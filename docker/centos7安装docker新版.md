It looks like there is a conflict between the existing Docker package (`docker-common-2:1.13.1-209.git7d71120.el7.centos.x86_64`) and the Docker CE package you are trying to install (`docker-ce-3:25.0.0-1.el7.x86_64`).

To resolve this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Remove the Existing Docker Package:**
   Remove the existing Docker package before installing the Docker CE packages:

   ```bash
     sudo yum remove docker-common
   ```

   This command will remove the conflicting Docker package.

2. **Clean the Yum Cache:**
   Clean the Yum cache to ensure there are no leftover files from the old package:

   ```bash
   sudo yum clean all
   ```

3. **Install Docker CE:**
   Now, proceed with the installation of Docker CE as mentioned in the previous instructions:

   ```bash
     yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
     yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
     yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

   If you still encounter conflicts, you can use the `--skip-broken` option:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y --skip-broken docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

4. **Start Docker Service:**
   Start the Docker service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

5. **Enable Docker on Boot:**
   Enable Docker to start on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

6. **Verify Docker Installation:**
   Check that Docker is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   sudo docker --version
   ```

   Also, run a test container:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

   Ensure that Docker is functioning as expected.

These steps should help you resolve the conflicts and install Docker CE on CentOS 7. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask.
